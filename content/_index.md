# Who I Am:
I'm a self taught developer working on designing complex simulations and functional apps with the Godot Engine. My focus is on performance, usability, and realistic mechanics, whether in game development or practical software solutions. I also actively contribute the tools I come up with as I develop to the open-source community.

Aviation has always been a big part of my life and it's something I've always been passionate about. My main project reflects that interest and is a way for me to stay actively involved with that community. In fact, the only reason I started to learn how to code and create was because of the lack of modern simulations made in the older styles.

# My Projects: 
**RotorSim** - A retro-style helicopter simulation built in the Godot Engine focused on easy to pick up mechanics. Fly around and test your skills with 3 different aircraft in a dynamic, mission-filled world. A game is currently available to wishlist on Steam, and you can visit Itch.io or the RotorSim discord to play test builds and voice your opinions on the game's direction.

**FocusBerry** - A Minimalistic Productivity Tool that stays out of your way so you can get your work done quickly and efficiently. Still in development, but will be released soon.
