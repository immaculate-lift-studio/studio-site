FocusBerry is a minimalist productivity tool designed to help you stay focused without distractions. Using the Pomodoro Technique, it structures work sessions based on your desired schedule, gently reminding you when to take breaks and when to resume work. To keep you motivated, FocusBerry tracks your progress with virtual berries that multiply as you complete focus sessions.


### What is the Pomodoro Technique?
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that breaks work into structured intervals, typically 25 minutes of focused work followed by a 5-minute break. After completing a set number of cycles, a longer break is taken to prevent burnout. This technique can help improve concentration, maintain productivity, and reduce mental fatigue by ensuring a balance between focused effort and rest.
