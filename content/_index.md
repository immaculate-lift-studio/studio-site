# Who I Am:
A self-taught developer designing complex simulations and functional apps with the Godot Engine. My focus is performance, usability, and realistic mechanics â€“
in both game development and practical software solutions. I also actively contribute to the open-source community by sharing the tools I come up while developing projects.

Aviation has been a big part of my life and it's something I've always been passionate about. My main project reflects that interest and is a way for me to stay actively involved with the community. In fact, the only reason I started learning how to code and create was because of the lack of modern simulations made in older styles.


# My Projects: 
**RotorSim** - A retro-inspired helicopter simulation built in the Godot Engine focused on easy to pick up mechanics. Fly around and test your skills with 3 different aircraft in a dynamic, mission-filled world. The game is currently available to wishlist on Steam, and you can visit Itch.io or the RotorSim discord to play test builds and voice your opinions on the game's direction.

**FocusBerry** - A minimalistic productivity tool that stays out of your way so you can get work done quickly and efficiently. Still in development, but will be released soon.
