Take to the skies in RotorSim, a retro-inspired helicopter simulation that blends classic 90s flight sims with modern accessibility. Fly three unique helicopters, each with distinct handling, as you complete 30 missions ranging from rescue ops to cargo transport. Dynamic weather effects like storms, fog, and wind add to the challenge, while a sim-cade flight model keeps controls intuitiveâ€”no expensive peripherals required. Whether tackling missions or exploring in free flight mode, RotorSim runs smoothly even on low-end hardware, including the Steam Deck.
